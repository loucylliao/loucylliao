### Hello! ![icon](https://graphic.neocities.org/tumblr_lngplwQozp1qfel73.gif)

**I'm [Loucyl](https://loucylliao.github.io/loucyl/) aspiring Software Engineer.**

- ðŸ”­ **Currently** building websites and interactive projects
- ðŸŒ± **Learning** Python, automation, and AI

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C++, SQL, Java, Assembly
**Passions:** Web Development, UI/UX Design

I'm captivated by the magic of programmingâ€”where mere letters and numbers transform into living, breathing digital experiences. There's poetry in writing syntax that awakens functionality, crafting elegant solutions from abstract thought, and building bridges between imagination and interaction.

Outside of coding, I explore the human experience through writingâ€”delving into our peculiar tendencies, life's beautiful ironies, and how the world reflects upon the soul.
